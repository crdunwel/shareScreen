shareScreen
===========

A nodeJS app for securely chatting with others and sharing a common screen for drawing or sharing click/drag pictures from your desktop. 

How to run locally
------------------

- Install library packages using npm install.

- Run local server securely by executing “sudo node server.js”.

- Type “https://localhost:443” into your browser URL.

- Since the security certificate is self-generated then you’ll probably get a message about security. If this app was in production then a trusted certificate would be used.

- The fake data generated a user so enter “clay” for username and “taxers” for password. Proceed to login.
